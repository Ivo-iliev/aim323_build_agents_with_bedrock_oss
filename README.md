## Build Agentic Workflows with Amazon Bedrock and Open Source Frameworks

This repository contains code for a multi-agent approach to help in deal flow of venture capital companies.

Labs Include

**Lab 1: AI Financial Assistant Use Case Introduction**
- Explore the travel assistant use case, covering the dataset on deals, analysts, and preferences used throughout the labs. We’ll also set up Amazon Bedrock models to enable intelligent response generation and data retrieval, laying the groundwork for the assistant’s capabilities in upcoming labs.

**Lab 2: Building a Financial Analyst with a Simple LangGraph**
- Learn the fundamentals of LangGraph, including nodes, edges, graphs, and memory concepts. Through a hands-on exercise, you’ll use these elements to build a simple investment analysis system.

**Lab 3: Analyst agent with tools**
- Build an analyst chatbot agent designed to assist users in finding deal history in a given industry. This agent will have access to various tools to search based on the target industry and previous deal information. Additionally, it will use a retrieval tool to provide in-depth information on different deals.

**Lab 4: Travel booking multi-agent**
- Implement a supervisor agentic pattern for handling deal analysis and communications. Here, a central supervisor agent coordinates multiple specialized agents, each with its own dedicated scratchpad. The supervisor agent acts as a coordinator, assigning tasks to the Deal Agent and Communication Agent based on their respective functions—such as searching, retrieving deals, finding the most experienced analyst in an industry and writing an introductory email.
