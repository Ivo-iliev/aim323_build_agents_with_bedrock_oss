    "[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) offers a variety of foundation models (FMs) that are optimized for different use cases, making it a versatile platform for building generative AI applications. For agentic workflows, where models interact with tools, make decisions, and carry out complex tasks autonomously, choosing the right FM is crucial. For the purposes of this demostration, we will use the foundational models available on Amazon Bedrock with a focus on Anthropic Claude, Meta’s models, and Amazon’s own models, highlighting their capabilities for demonstration purposes. You can take a look [Supported foundation models in Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html)"
